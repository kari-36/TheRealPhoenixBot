Use this module to translate stuff... duh!

*Commands:*
• `/tl` (or `/tr`): as a reply to a message, translates it to English.

• `/tl <lang>`: translates to <lang>
eg: `/tl ja`: translates to Japanese.

• `/tl <source>//<dest>`: translates from <source> to <lang>.
eg: `/tl ja//en`: translates from Japanese to English.

• `/langs`: get a list of supported languages for translation."""
